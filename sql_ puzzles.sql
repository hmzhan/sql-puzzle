/*Correlated Subquery*/

/*Many queries can be evaluated by executing the subquery once and substituting the resulting value or values into the WHERE clause of the outer query. In queries that include a correlated subquery (also known as a repeating subquery), the subquery depends on the outer query for its values. This means that the subquery is executed repeatedly, once for each row that might be selected by the outer query.
This query retrieves one instance of each employee's first and last name for which the bonus in the SalesPerson table is 5000 and for which the employee identification numbers match in the Employee and SalesPerson tables.
USE AdventureWorks2008R2;
GO
SELECT DISTINCT c.LastName, c.FirstName, e.BusinessEntityID 
FROM Person.Person AS c JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
ON e.BusinessEntityID = c.BusinessEntityID 
WHERE 5000.00 IN
    (SELECT Bonus
    FROM Sales.SalesPerson sp
    WHERE e.BusinessEntityID = sp.BusinessEntityID) ;
GO
Here is the result set.
LastName FirstName BusinessEntityID
-------------------------- ---------- ------------
Ansman-Wolfe Pamela 280
Saraiva Jos√© 282
(2 row(s) affected)
The previous subquery in this statement cannot be evaluated independently of the outer query. It needs a value for Employee.BusinessEntityID, but this value changes as SQL Server examines different rows in Employee.
That is exactly how this query is evaluated: SQL Server considers each row of the Employee table for inclusion in the results by substituting the value in each row into the inner query. For example, if SQL Server first examines the row for Syed Abbas, the variable Employee.BusinessEntityID takes the value 285, which SQL Server substitutes into the inner query.
USE AdventureWorks2008R2;
GO
SELECT Bonus
FROM Sales.SalesPerson
WHERE BusinessEntityID = 285;
The result is 0 (Syed Abbas did not receive a bonus because he is not a sales person), so the outer query evaluates to:
USE AdventureWorks2008R2;
GO
SELECT LastName, FirstName
FROM Person.Person AS c JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
ON e.BusinessEntityID = c.BusinessEntityID 
WHERE 5000 IN (0.00)
Because this is false, the row for Syed Abbas is not included in the results. Go through the same procedure with the row for Pamela Ansman-Wolfe. You will see that this row is included in the results.
Correlated subqueries can also include table-valued functions in the FROM clause by referencing columns from a table in the outer query as an argument of the table-valued function. In this case, for each row of the outer query, the table-valued function is evaluated according to the subquery.*/





/*Primary Key Constraints
A table typically has a column or combination of columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in the table. This column, or columns, is called the primary key (PK) of the table and enforces the entity integrity of the table. Because primary key constraints guarantee unique data, they are frequently defined on an identity column.
When you specify a primary key constraint for a table, the Database Engine enforces data uniqueness by automatically creating a unique index for the primary key columns. This index also permits fast access to data when the primary key is used in queries. If a primary key constraint is defined on more than one column, values may be duplicated within one column, but each combination of values from all the columns in the primary key constraint definition must be unique.
As shown in the following illustration, the ProductID and VendorID columns in the Purchasing.ProductVendor table form a composite primary key constraint for this table. This makes sure that that every row in the ProductVendor table has a unique combination of ProductID and VendorID. This prevents the insertion of duplicate rows.
Composite PRIMARY KEY constraint
A table can contain only one primary key constraint.
A primary key cannot exceed 16 columns and a total key length of 900 bytes.
The index generated by a primary key constraint cannot cause the number of indexes on the table to exceed 999 nonclustered indexes and 1 clustered index.
If clustered or nonclustered is not specified for a primary key constraint, clustered is used if there no clustered index on the table.
All columns defined within a primary key constraint must be defined as not null. If nullability is not specified, all columns participating in a primary key constraint have their nullability set to not null.
If a primary key is defined on a CLR user-defined type column, the implementation of the type must support binary ordering.
Foreign Key Constraints
A foreign key (FK) is a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables to control the data that can be stored in the foreign key table. In a foreign key reference, a link is created between two tables when the column or columns that hold the primary key value for one table are referenced by the column or columns in another table. This column becomes a foreign key in the second table.
For example, the Sales.SalesOrderHeader table has a foreign key link to the Sales.SalesPerson table because there is a logical relationship between sales orders and salespeople. The SalesPersonID column in the SalesOrderHeader table matches the primary key column of the SalesPerson table. The SalesPersonID column in the SalesOrderHeader table is the foreign key to the SalesPerson table. By creating this foreign key relationship, a value for SalesPersonID cannot be inserted into the SalesOrderHeader table if it does not already exist in the SalesPerson table.
Indexes on Foreign Key Constraints
Unlike primary key constraints, creating a foreign key constraint does not automatically create a corresponding index. However, manually creating an index on a foreign key is often useful for the following reasons:
Foreign key columns are frequently used in join criteria when the data from related tables is combined in queries by matching the column or columns in the foreign key constraint of one table with the primary or unique key column or columns in the other table. An index enables the Database Engine to quickly find related data in the foreign key table. However, creating this index is not required. Data from two related tables can be combined even if no primary key or foreign key constraints are defined between the tables, but a foreign key relationship between two tables indicates that the two tables have been optimized to be combined in a query that uses the keys as its criteria.
Changes to primary key constraints are checked with foreign key constraints in related tables.*/
